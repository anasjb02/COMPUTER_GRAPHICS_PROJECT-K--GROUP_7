2D Interactive Village

Project Overview
A computer graphics project developed using C++ and the OpenGL (GLUT) framework. The project renders a complex, animated 2D landscape featuring a riverside village, mountains, and dynamic sky elements. 

The core objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of 2D geometric transformations, animation loops, particle systems(rain simulation), and interactive state management (Day/Night cycles).

Key Features
Dynamic Day & Night Cycle: Users can toggle between day and night modes, changing the sky gradient, celestial bodies (Sun/Moon), and environment lighting.
Weather Simulation: Features a custom particle system to simulate rain with adjustable density.
Complex Scenery: Includes multi-layered backgrounds, detailed house structures, vegetation, and a river dock.

Animations:
    * Looping movement of upper and lower boats.
    * Rotating wind turbine blades.
    * Moving clouds and airplane traversal.
Interactive Lighting: Toggleable window lights for houses during night mode.

Controls
The scene is fully interactive using the keyboard and mouse:

| `N` | Switch to Night Mode |
| `D` | Switch to Day Mode |
| `R` | Toggle Rain Simulation |
| `L` | Toggle House Lights |
| `T` | Toggle Tent Visibility |
| Left Click | Resume Animation |
| Right Click | Pause Animation |
